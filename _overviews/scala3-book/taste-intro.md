This chapter provides a whirlwind tour of the main features of the Scala 3 programming language.
After this initial tour, the rest of the book provides more details on these features, and the [Reference documentation][reference] provides _many_ more details.

> Throughout this book, we recommend you to experiment with the examples on [Scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org), or in the Scala REPL, which is demonstrated shortly.
