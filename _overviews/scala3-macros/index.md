## Scala 3 Macro Tutorial
A [tutorial][tutorial] to cover all the features involved in writing macros in Scala 3.

## Migrating Macros
Scala 3 provides a toolbox full of metaprogramming features, which are safer, more robust, and much more stable than their counterparts in Scala 2. Implementing macro libraries in Scala 3 is simpler and the resulting libraries are easier to maintain across future versions of Scala. The improvements come at a price: the metaprogramming facilities have been re-designed from the ground up. In consequence, existing macro libraries need to be ported to the new interfaces.

In the [Migrating Macros](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-3-migration-guide/docs/macros/macro-libraries.html) section, you will find helpful content to port your macros code to Scala 3.
